# Softmax

## Description of Layer

Formally Softmax is a linear operator that maps $`\mathbb{R}^{n}`$ to $`\mathcal{U}_{n}`$, where $`\mathcal{U}_{n}`$ is the space of probability distributions for discrete random variables with $`n`$ possible outcomes. Importantly for a vector $`v \in \mathbb{R}^{n}`$ it maps each component of $`v`$ to the interval $`(0,1)`$ and satisfies the sum of the components is $`1`$. The definition of the map is

$$ \begin{align*} \mathrm{Softmax}(v):& \mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathcal{U}_{n} \\
&v \mapsto \left(\frac{\exp(v_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}\exp(v_{j})}\right)_{i=1}^{n}\end{align*} $$

The Softmax layer is used to inside a transformer to map a tensor of weighted values to a probability distribution. The QKV layer produces three tensors:
 
 - The query $` Q \in \mathbb{R}^{h}`$
 - The keys $` K \in \mathbb{R}^{s\times h}`$
 - The values $` V \in \mathbb{R}^{s \times h}`$

 where $` h`$ is the head dimension and $`s`$ is the sequence length. Softmax is employed on $`QK^{\intercal}\in \mathbb{R}^{s}`$, namely we calculate 

 $$ \begin{align*} \mathrm{Softmax}\left(\frac{QK^{\intercal}}{\sqrt{h}}\right) = \left(\frac{\exp(\frac{QK^{\intercal}_{i}}{\sqrt{h}})}{\sum_{j=1}^{s}\exp(\frac{QK^{\intercal}_{j}}{\sqrt{h}})}\right)_{i=1}^{s}.\end{align*} $$

 ### Shift Invariance

 One of the key properties of Softmax which we make use of to both stabilise inference and to assist with proving is that is invariant under shifts. That is given a vector $`v\in\mathbb{R}^{d}`$ and a constant vector $c \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ then 

 $$ \begin{align*}  \mathrm{Softmax}(v - c)_{i} &= \frac{\exp(v_{i}-c)}{\sum_{j=1}^{d}\exp(v_{j}-c)} \\ &=\frac{\exp(-c)\cdot\exp(v_{i})}{\exp(-c)\cdot\sum_{j=1}^{d}\exp(v_{j})}\\ &=\frac{\exp(v_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{d}\exp(v_{j})} \\ &= \mathrm{Softmax}(v)_{i}.\end{align*} $$

 ## Proving the Layer

 Due to the highly non-linear nature, and the fact that the $`\exp`$ function has no natural analogue over a finite field $`\mathbb{F}`$, we employ lookups to prove correct execution of softmax. The technique is largely based on that proposed in [zkLLM][1], the notable differences being due to Deep Proves use of the Goldilocks field we perform quantisation differently. 

  ### Exponential Tables
 In order to reuse lookup tables between softmax layers we assume that the scaling factor of the quantised inputs is the same everytime. For this we pick a suitable power of $`2`$ (in our case $`2^{24}`$) and consider our quantised values $`q`$ to be such that if $`x\in\mathbb{R}`$ then $`2^{24} \cdot x = q`$. 

 Additionally it is assumed that all inputs to the $`\exp`$ lookup are negative, this is to give better stability. This can always be achieved by subtracting a suitable constant before the lookup, and then multiplying the output by a suitable constant after.

 The scaling factor of $`2^{24}`$ means that we can treat inputs as $`32`$-bit numbers with $`8`$-integral bits and $`24`$-fractional bits. We then chunk our inputs into $`8`$-bit limbs, the two most significant are passed to tables that compute the exponential while the two least significant are range checked. The two least significant chunks do not have to bexponentiated as they represent values between $`-(2^{-8})`$ and $`-(2^{-24})`$ and the exponential of any number in this range is ~$`1`$.

 The below image demonstrates how this lookup works:

 ![EXP Lookup](./img/EXP-Lookups.png)

 For a more illustrative example consider the following. We have input matrices $Q, K$ and these both have scale factor $`2^{-s}`$ where $`s\in\mathbb{R}`$. (same scaling factor for sake of explanation + representation as power of two since scale factors are always positive)

Then we calculate $Q\cdot K^{\intercal}$ and this now has scale factor $`2^{-2s}`$. If we were doing this as we normally do this would mean $`s_{1} = 2^{-s}, s_{2} = 2^{-s}`$ and we haven’t defined $`s_{3}`$ yet (normally we rescale by $`\frac{s_{1}\cdot s_{2}}{s_{3}}`$). So we stick with $`s_{1} \cdot s_{2}`$ as the multiplier and then the exponential lookup table expects its input column to have multiplier $`2^{24}`$. So as long as $`s_{1} \cdot s_{2} > 2^{-24}`$ we can perform the lookup (without requantising first). If $`s_{1}\cdot s_{2} > 2^{-24}`$, then we can find some $y\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $`s_{1} \cdot s_{2} \cdot 2^{-y} = 2^{-24}`$. So then prover take $`Q\cdot K^{\intercal}`$ and multiply by $`2^{y}`$ (rounded so that it can be converted into a field element). Now the prover can directly pass into the lookup and they use this to obtain the softmax output.

To see this in further detail observe that $`q\in Q$ and $k \in K`$ were both quantised numbers (so they are integers), they correspond to floats as $`q = 2^{s} \cdot x_{q}`$ and $`k = 2^{s}\cdot x_{k}`$. So after the matrix multiplication we would have $`qk = 2^{s} \cdot 2^{s} \cdot x_{q} \cdot x_{k}`$ then we also have that $`\frac{qk}{2^{2s}} = x_{q} \cdot x_{k}`$ - we stay on the bigger type with bigger bitsize so no need for “s3” - or we consider s3=1, i.e. requant range == output range of the operation.

Since $`qk = 2^{2s} \cdot x_{q} \cdot x_{k}`$ in order use the same lookup table each time we want the power of two to always be $`24`$. So find $`y`$ that satisfies $`2s + y = 24`$ and multiply both sides by $`2^{y}`$. Now we have $`2^{y} \cdot qk = 2^{24}\cdot x_{q} \cdot x_{k}`$. In order to get back to float we just have divide by $`2^{24}`$ giving $`\frac{2^{y}\cdot qk}{2^{24}} = x_{q}\cdot x_{k}`$.

 ### Normalisation

 Proving the normalisation is tricky so rather than doing it explicitly for a vector $`z\in\mathbb{F}^{s}`$ we view it as an integer and dequantise entry-by-entry, via the formula $`\gamma \cdot z_{i} = x_{i}`$. This yields a vector $`x\in\mathbb{R}^{s}`$. Using this we compute

 $$ \hat{z} := \frac{\sqrt{s}}{\gamma}\ln\left(\sum_{j=1}^{s}\exp\left(\frac{x_{j}}{\sqrt{s}}\right)\right). $$

 We then compute $`X = z - \hat{z}`$ element-wise resulting in a vector of values that are all negative. We perform the $`\exp`$ lookup described above on $`X`$ to obtain $`Y`$. If the prover acts honestly then we have $`Y = \mathrm{Softmax}(z)`$. By the fact we used the $`\exp`$ lookup we know that $`Y`$ contains the exponentials of the elements of $`X`$. But $`X`$ was constructed in such a way that its entries should sum to $`1`$. We write $`\theta`$ for the scaling factor of $`Y`$, then observe:

 $$ \begin{align*} \exp\left(\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{s}}\cdot(z_{i} - \hat{z})\right) &= \exp\left(\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{s}}\cdot\left(z_{i}-\frac{\sqrt{s}}{\gamma}\ln\left(\sum_{j=1}^{s}\exp\left(\frac{x_{j}}{\sqrt{s}}\right)\right)\right)\right) \\ &= \exp\left(\frac{x_{i}}{\sqrt{s}}-\ln\left(\sum_{j=1}^{s}\exp\left(\frac{x_{j}}{\sqrt{s}}\right)\right)\right) \\ &=\frac{\exp\left(\frac{x_{i}}{\sqrt{s}}\right)}{\sum_{j=1}^{s}\exp\left(\frac{x_{j}}{\sqrt{s}}\right)} \\ &=\frac{1}{\theta}Y_{i}\end{align*} $$

 So if $`Y`$ has been computed correctly then its entries should sum to $`\frac{1}{\theta}`$. We choose our scaling factor $`\frac{1}{\theta}`$ to be $`2^{8}`$, hence we just have to check that the entries of $`Y`$ sum to $`256`$ plus or minus some error.

 ### Allowable Error
 
 Using the formula provided by [zkLLM][1] we can find a suitable bound for the error in normalisation. This error occurs due to rounding in quantisation which can mean the final sum does not always equal $`\frac{1}{\theta}`$. To prove we are in an acceptable range during setup an error bound is determined and we range check the difference between the sum of $`Y`$ and $`\frac{1}{\theta}`$ to be within this range.

 To calculate this range we denote by $`B_{M}`$ the integer such that $`\exp(-\gamma \cdot B_{M}/\sqrt{s}) \approx 0`$ and $`B_{L}`$ the value such that $`\exp(-\gamma \cdot B_{L}/\sqrt{s}) \approx 1`$. 

 We work out the optimal value of $`B_{M}`$ as 
 $$ \begin{align*} B_{M} := \frac{\sqrt{s}\cdot(\ln(2h)+\ln(1/\theta))}{2\cdot\gamma}.\end{align*} $$

 This allows us to calculate the allowable error bound for $`L1`$-error, $`\epsilon`$, as 

 $$ \begin{align*} \epsilon := C\cdot \exp\left(\frac{\gamma}{2\sqrt{s}}\right)+(h-1)\cdot\exp\left(\frac{-\gamma\cdot B_{M}}{\sqrt{s}}\right),\end{align*} $$

 in the above the constant $`C`$ is defined as 

 $$\begin{align*} C:= \exp\left(\frac{\gamma B_{L}}{\sqrt{s}}\right)+\frac{\theta\cdot\exp\left(\frac{\gamma B_{M}}{\sqrt{s}}\right)}{2} - 1.\end{align*}$$

 We then range check that the sum of the output is within the range $`(1\pm\epsilon)\cdot\frac{1}{\theta}`$.

### Diagram
